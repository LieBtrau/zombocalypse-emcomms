    "# Why NVIS antenna configuration?\n",
    "## Properties\n",
    "* easy to setup : no installation on height needed\n",
    "* hard to jam and locate (direction finding) : energy goes straight up\n",
    "* simple and cheap antenna : horizontal dipole\n",
    "* omnidirectional coverage\n",
    "* works well with low power\n",
    "* range limited to a few 100 kms\n",
    "* frequency limited to 2-10MHz, depending on ionospheric conditions\n",
    "    * 4 - 8MHz during day : 40m band\n",
    "    * 2 - 4MHz at night : 80m band\n",
    "* other party should also have NVIS antenna\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frequencies\n",
    "* Must be high enough, otherwise too much D-layer absorption\n",
    "* Must be low enough to be refracted by F-layer.  Maximum frequency is the Ionospheric foF2 critical frequency.\n",
    "* [Space Weather Services - Ionospheric Map](https://www.sws.bom.gov.au/HF_Systems/6/5)\n",
    "* 80m band seems to be the only viable option in western Europe\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "* Radiation angle (typically 75° for NVIS) increases as active element is lowered (typicallyλ 0.10 to 0.25λ above ground)\n",
    "* Mounting horizontal dipole lower means more ground losses and need for retuning (shortening)\n",

    "    * For 40m dipole, buy length of 25m\n",
