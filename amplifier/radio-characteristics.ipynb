    "# Requirements\n",
    "* Cheap to build\n",
    "    * No toroid winding\n",
    "    * No tuning\n",
    "    * SMD parts keep the assembly cost down\n",
    "* Easy to build (hand soldering)\n",
    "    * No parts smaller than 0603\n",
    "    * No QFN\n",

    "# Frequency band\n",
    "It's allowed for non-hams to transmit in this band.  The allowed power levels are high enough so that a QRP-power amplifier can be built for it.  As the band is near the end of the HF-band, it poses some challenges for the development of this amplifier.  If we can make it work for this frequency band, the lower frequency bands should be a piece of cake.\n",
    "\n",
    "* CB-band, 11m band\n",
    "* 26.965MHz to 27.405MHz, 10kHz channel spacing, 40-channels\n",
    "\n",
    "# Power\n",
    "* AM: 4W erp\n",
    "* SSB : 12W pep\n",
