    "## Primary winding inductance\n",
    "Suitable for 5-30MHz.  For 13 windings, the inductance at 3MHz is 13.9µH while it even rises to 23µH at 30MHz.  This behavior matches the µ'-curve of the material permeability versus frequency of the [#61 material datasheet](https://www.fair-rite.com/61-material-data-sheet/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Secondary winding inductance\n",
    "The secondary coil has a resonance frequency of around 3MHz.  On such a small core, the windings are very close to each other, resulting in a large capacitive coupling and a low self-resonant frequency.\n",
    "This core is too small for so many windings."
