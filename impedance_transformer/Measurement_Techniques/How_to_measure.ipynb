    "1. 1x NanoVNA\n",
    "2. Good USB-A cable for the NanoVNA.  Cables with high resistance will cause the NanoVNA to reset.\n",
    "3. 2x SMA to SMA cable (as short as possible.)  Even better is to test without any cable and attach your DUT directly to the NanoVNA.\n",
    "4. SMA male/female adapters.  To connect the SMA cables to the NanoVNA.\n",
    "5. 2x SMA-connector to solder wires to.  In case connecting with SMA cables:  Make sure there's a good ground connection between these SMA-connectors.  Solder them onto a perfboard, close to each other and provide ground connection between them.\n",

    "## Measurement 1 : 1-turn check\n",
    "### Calibration\n",
    "1. Sweep Control → Start (e.g. 50kHz)\n",
    "2. Sweep Control → Stop (e.g. 10MHz), or another frequency that is higher than the self-resonant frequency.\n",
    "3. Data points : 1023\n",
    "4. Perform 1-Port calibration on the NanoVNA\n",
    "For more info, see [My Tips & tricks](https://github.com/LieBtrau/electronics-design-data/blob/master/RF/nanoVNA.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurement\n",
    "1. Make a single core inductor with 1 turn of wire (i.e. one single wire through the toroid) and connect it to port 0 of the NanoVNA.\n",
    "2. You won't have a frequency point at 500kHz, write down the closest frequency point and the corresponding impedance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculations\n",
    "The measured inductance at 500kHz is the Al value (in nH/N²) of the toroid.  Check if this value matches the datasheet of the toroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Construction of the transformer\n",
    "### Calculation\n",
    "1. Calculate the number of turns for the primary coil : calc_primary_turns()\n",
    "2. Caluclate the needed wire length for the primary and secondary coil : calc_toroid_wirelength()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Construction\n",
    "1. Wind the secondary coil on the toroid and fixate it with tape.\n",
    "2. Wind the primary coil on the toroid, over the secondary coil and fixate it with tape.\n",

    "## Measurement 2 : Low frequency behavior of a transformer\n",
    "### Calibration\n",
    "Keep the calibration from the previous measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurement\n",
    "1. Connect the primary coil to port 1 of the NanoVNA.\n",
    "2. You won't have a frequency point at 500kHz, write down the closest frequency point and the corresponding impedance:\n",
    "  1. With the secondary coil open, measure the impedance of the primary coil near 500kHz and store the results in a Touchstone S1P-file.\n",
    "  2. With the secondary coil shorted, measure the impedance of the primary coil near 500kHz and store the results in a Touchstone S1P-file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Touchstone files will not be used for the calculations, but they can be used to verify the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculations\n",
    "1. The **self-resonant frequency** is found with calcSRF(nw) in [calcinductors.py](../Calculations/calcInductors.py).\n",
    "2. The **expected transformer bandwidth** can now be calculated using transformer_bandwidth_calculation() in [calcinductors.py](../Calculations/calcInductors.py).\n",
